### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


## About Me
As a Fullstack Engineer with 7 years of experience, I have a strong background in creating and maintaining high-quality software products.

My key accomplishments include implementing a highly scalable and maintainable distributed SaaS application which involved designing and developing a fault-tolerant system that could handle high traffic loads, utilizing microservice architecture, Golang, message queues, and load balancing. I also have experience building web and mobile applications using React and React Native.

Additionally, I have experience in leading distributed engineering teams while providing focused education for junior engineers.

I am a self-motivated and detail-oriented engineer who is passionate about building high-quality software. I enjoy working in a collaborative environment and am always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn new technologies.
